# Comparison_of_Bidding_Methods_Conversion_Using_AB_Testing

Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, 'average bidding', as an alternative to the existing bidding type called 'maximum bidding'.
One of the customers decided to test this new feature and wants to do an A/B test to see if average bidding converts more than maximum bidding.
A/B testing has been going on for 1 month and the customer is waiting for the results of the A/B testing to be analyzed.

The success criterion is Purchase. Therefore, the focus should be on the Purchase metric for AB testing.
